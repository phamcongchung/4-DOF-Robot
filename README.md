# 4-DOF-Robot
OVERVIEW: This repository contains simulation files for my team's 4-DOF robot arm, as well as introduction to the problem of the robot kinematics. The simulation is created and run on MATLAB Simscape. The 3D models are made in Solidworks.

USER GUIDE: Run .slx and .m on MATLAB Simscape. The kinematics problem is explained in .doc files
